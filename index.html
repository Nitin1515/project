        <p>Look at our wide range of coffees</p>
        <h3>Cappuccino</h3>
        <img src="/images/cappuchino.jpg" width="300" height="200">
        <p style="width: 60%">A cappuccino is an espresso-based coffee drink that is traditionally prepared with steamed milk foam. Variations of the drink involve the use of cream instead of milk, using non-dairy milk substitutes and flavoring with cinnamon or chocolate powder.</p>
        <p>Cost : Rs.100</p>
        <h3>Espresso</h3>
        <img src="/images/espresso.jpg" width="300" height="200">
        <p style="width: 60%">Espresso is a coffee-brewing method of Italian origin, in which a small amount of nearly boiling water is forced under 9–10 bars of pressure through finely-ground coffee beans. Espresso can be made with a wide variety of coffee beans and roast degrees.</p>
        <p>Cost : Rs.120</p>
        <h3>Latte</h3>
        <img src="/images/latte.jpg" width="300" height="200">
        <p style="width: 60%;">Caffè latte, often shortened to just latte in English, is a coffee drink of Italian origin made with espresso and steamed milk.</p>
        <p>Cost : Rs.170</p>
        <h3>Americano</h3>
        <img src="/images/amira.jpg" width="300" height="200">
        <p style="width: 60%;">Caffè Americano is a type of coffee drink prepared by diluting an espresso with hot water, giving it a different flavor from traditionally brewed coffee. Its strength varies with the number of shots of espresso and amount of water added.</p>
        <p>Cost : Rs.220</p>
        <h3>Double coffee Milkshake</h3>
        <img src="/images/double coffee.jpg" width="300" height="200">
        <p style="width: 60%;">Two different types of coffee are blended together with a glass of milk, served chill.</p>
        <p>Cost : Rs.270</p>
        <h3>Iced Coffee</h3>
        <img src="/images/iced.jpg" width="300" height="200">
        <p style="width: 60%;">Iced coffee is a coffee beverage served cold. It may be prepared either by brewing coffee normally and then serving it over ice or in cold milk or by brewing the coffee cold. In hot brewing, sweeteners and flavoring may be added before cooling, as they dissolve faster.</p>
        <p>Cost : Rs.220</p>
        <h3>Coffee Cake</h3>
        <img src="/images/cake.jpg" width="300" height="200">
        <p style="width: 60%;">Coffee cake may refer to a sponge cake flavored with coffee or, in the United States, a sweet cake intended to be eaten with coffee or tea. A coffee-flavored cake is typically baked in a circular shape with two layers separated by coffee butter icing, which may also cover the top of the cake.</p>  
        <p>Cost : Rs.220</p>
